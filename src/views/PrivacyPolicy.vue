        <h2>Encryption in Transit</h2>
        <p>All data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted using industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. This encryption ensures that your data remains confidential during transmission, reducing the risk of interception by unauthorized parties.</p>

        <h2>Encryption at Rest</h2>
        <p>Your sensitive data, once stored in our database, is also protected through encryption. We use advanced encryption methods to secure your information while it is stored on our servers. This means that even if someone gains unauthorized access to our database, they will not be able to decipher your data without the necessary encryption keys.</p>

        <p>Access to your data is strictly controlled and limited to authorized personnel who require it for legitimate purposes. We have implemented role-based access control mechanisms to ensure that only the individuals with the appropriate permissions can access and manipulate your data.</p>
