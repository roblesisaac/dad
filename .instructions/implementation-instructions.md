Implement the next incomplete task(s) in the task file "Tasks" section. These are your instructions on how to implement: Read it carefully first and confirm whether you need any additional context, assumptions, or clarifications before starting. If you need clarification stop implementation and ask the user.

If no clarification is needed begin implementing the next task. As you complete it, immediately mark it as [x] in the task file document and immediately annotate the file as you discover findings and make file changes so progress is visible in real time.

If you discover gaps, risks, or needed clarifications while working, add brief annotations directly in the task file near the relevant task and proceed using your best judgement and sensible assumptions whenever possible.

Do not complete the entire task list. Work in small, logical batches: complete the next unchecked task (or a tightly related group), then mark each as [x] as soon as it’s done.

Keep your responses in the chat very brief. Instead annotate the task file with any findings/modifications/decisions/etc.
